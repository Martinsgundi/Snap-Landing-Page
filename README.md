## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- TailwindCss
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I just learnt Tailwindcss, so I used this project to practise what I learnt, and I can say it was worth it because I am now very familiar with most of the utility classes used in Tailwindcss.
Also this project added to my knowledge of Javascript as there's always a new thing I learn in Javascript after every project.


### Continued development

After finishing this project using Tailwindcss, I will surely want to learn more frameworks for different technologies as it make development much easier and faster.
